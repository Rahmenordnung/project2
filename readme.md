                #   Second Milestone Project
                
                
                ##Short description
                
                This short program that represents the second project for Front End developer diploma from Code Institute integrates javascript and d3 plus crossfilter and dc.js  as part of the Front end Development chapter
                
                used in conjunction with a csv. file. Its goal is to exctarct the data from the csv database and to design with it statistical functions that ease the final lecture of the data and it's interpretation
                
                In this case the data belongs to an American Toys company that with the purpose of of expansion has presented an extract of thei sales with the purpose of understanding the market trends.
                
                In addition I have added a small basic page as a preseentation of the listed products in the graphs in which I have used some small javascript functions.
                
                
                ## Project##
                
                
                
                I tryed to be at the same time as original as possible. Create texts and images produced by so many years of looking this cartoons and crate a page  inspired by the fun and pleasure that I feal when I watch them.  

                
                
                
                ##Project implementation
                
                In the constuction of the project I have used the ** libraries ** donated by the Code institute, 
                
                + d3.js, 
                
                + crossfilter,
                
                + dc.js, 
                
                + queue.js 
                
                That were used for the graphs building. Also I have used jquery.js library that facilitates and is the most used js library, for different
                
                functions in the page.  Also I tryed to use bootstap exctracts, that have been completating the page and"Font awesome" and different types of special Fonts 
                
                imported from Google Fonts.
                
                Finally I have used the Google Maps API and added to it the clients adresses so that  the user can relate and see where each project has been delivered.
                
                
                
                ##Developer environment
                
                
                As for the external use of the program, the user should download  first the [Toys shop data base](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data/version/1).csv file.
                
                and upload then the above mentionated libraries, after that ,load the bootstap file and the dc.css as well as jquery so that the program should deploy as expected.
                
                
                
                ## Media ##
